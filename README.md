# HATE SPEECH ON BILLBOARD HOT 100 SONGS

In todayâ€™s era the music industry has experienced massive growth and has gone through major changes in its composition. As the use of bad languages alter our behaviour in a negative way, it is very essential to keep people away from music that promotes hate. The lower age groups are the target of such songs and are mostly influenced by the use of hate and discriminative language in songs. Therefore we need to detect and highlight such songs and create awareness.

Through this project it has been tried to detect hate speech using the BERT Multilingual model. The model has been fine tuned on the OLID dataset and then the transfer learning has been performed. Since the testing dataset consists of different languages, zero shot learning has also been experimented.
The model was able to achieve a 76% macro-F1 score and therefore the analysis made can be called effective. Also upon examining the most frequent words one could easily conclude our analysis produced desired results.
