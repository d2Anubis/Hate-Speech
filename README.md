# HATE SPEECH ON BILLBOARD HOT 100 SONGS

In todayâ€™s era, the music industry has experienced massive growth and has gone through major composition changes. As bad languages negatively alter our behavior, it is essential to keep people away from music that promotes hate. The lower age groups are the target of such songs and are mostly influenced by hate and discriminative language in songs. Therefore we need to detect and highlight such songs and create awareness.

Through this project, it has been tried to detect hate speech using the BERT Multilingual model. The model has been fine-tuned on the OLID dataset, and then the transfer learning has been performed. Since the testing dataset consists of different languages, zero-shot learning has also been experimented with.
The model achieved a 76% macro-F1 score, and therefore, the analysis made can be called effective. Also, upon examining the most frequent words, one could easily conclude our analysis produced desired results.
